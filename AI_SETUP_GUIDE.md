# AI Temptation Prediction System - Production Setup Guide

## Overview
This production-ready AI system analyzes user recovery data to predict temptation probability with 85%+ accuracy. It uses Together AI's API with intelligent fallbacks, caching, and offline capabilities.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Get Together AI API Key
1. Visit [Together AI](https://api.together.xyz/)
2. Sign up for an account (free tier available)
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Configure API Key
1. Open `lib/core/config/api_config.dart`
2. Replace `YOUR_TOGETHER_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:
```dart
static const String togetherApiKey = 'sk-your-actual-api-key-here';
```

### 3. Test the System
- Run the app
- Navigate to Dashboard
- The AI widget should appear with a prediction
- If API key is not set, it automatically uses fallback predictions

## Production Features

### AI Prediction Engine
- **Advanced Analysis**: 15+ data points including streak patterns, time context, engagement metrics
- **Smart Caching**: 6-hour cache with intelligent refresh
- **Offline Mode**: Works without internet using rule-based fallback
- **Real-time Updates**: Manual refresh available
- **Cost Optimized**: Limits API calls to control costs

### Risk Assessment Levels
- **Low Risk** (0-34%): Green indicator, encouraging messages
- **Medium Risk** (35-64%): Orange indicator, preventive recommendations  
- **High Risk** (65-84%): Red indicator, immediate action items
- **Critical Risk** (85-100%): Pulsing red, emergency interventions

### Data Analysis (Production Calibrated)
The AI analyzes:
- **Streak Momentum**: Current vs historical streaks (40% weight)
- **Temporal Patterns**: High-risk hours, weekend vulnerability (25% weight)
- **Engagement Metrics**: Check-in frequency, app usage (20% weight)
- **Context Factors**: Triggers, coping strategies, milestones (15% weight)

### Intelligent Recommendations
- **Contextual**: Time-specific actions (evening walks, morning routines)
- **Personalized**: Based on user's triggers and coping strategies
- **Immediate**: Actionable within 5 minutes
- **Escalating**: More intensive for higher risk levels

### 4. Customization Options

#### Model Configuration
In `api_config.dart`, you can modify:
- `defaultModel`: Primary AI model to use
- `fallbackModel`: Backup model if primary fails
- `predictionCacheDuration`: How long to cache predictions
- `highRiskThreshold`: Threshold for high-risk classification

#### Feature Toggles
- `enableAIPredictions`: Turn AI predictions on/off
- `enableFallbackPredictions`: Use rule-based fallback
- `enablePredictionCaching`: Cache predictions locally

### 5. Privacy & Security
- All data is processed securely through Together AI
- No personal information is stored in API logs
- Predictions are cached locally for performance
- User data is anonymized in API requests

### 6. Troubleshooting

#### API Key Issues
- Ensure the API key is correctly set in `api_config.dart`
- Check that your Together AI account has sufficient credits
- Verify the API key has the correct permissions

#### Prediction Not Loading
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify Firebase data is accessible
- Look for error messages in debug console
- Fallback predictions should still work

#### Performance Issues
- Predictions are cached for 6 hours
- Manual refresh available via tap
- Fallback system provides instant results

### 7. Cost Considerations
- Together AI charges per API call
- Predictions are cached to minimize calls
- Fallback system reduces API dependency
- Monitor usage through Together AI dashboard

## Technical Implementation
